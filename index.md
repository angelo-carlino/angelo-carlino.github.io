# Research

### Multi-objective adaptive decision-making for climate policy
I am interested in improving decision-making support systems in this context using:
- stochastic models
- multi-objective optimization
- evolutionary algorithms
- optimal control
- decision-making under deep uncertainty methods

### Low-carbon energy systems
- Life-cycle GHG emissions impact on power system planning
- Integrated modelling of regional energy and water systems for:
  + joint optimization of planning and operations
  + impact and vulnerability assessment of electricity systems under climate change
- Strategic dam planning, also using robust optimization

### Other research interests:
- Water resources systems modelling and simulation
- Limnology

### Other experience
I worked for two summers as an intern/researcher at EPFL & Eawag studying the bacterial layer in lake Cadagno, Switzerland.  <br>
The field campaigns resulted in <a href="https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.7127882.svg"> a publicly available dataset </a> which has been used in a number of studies.
