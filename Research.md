I aim to support infrastructural planning decisions in the energy and water sectors, focusing on increasing resilience to future socioeconomic and climate change uncertainties. My research seeks to reconcile traditional cost-minimization approaches with environmental and social objectives, advancing sustainable development.

From a methodological perspective, I focus on developing and applying techniques from evolutionary multi-objective optimization, stochastic optimal control, operations research, and artificial intelligence to address complex sustainability challenges.
