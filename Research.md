I aim to support infrastructural planning decisions for the energy and water sector to increase robustness to future socioeconomic and climate change. Additionally, I am interested in mitigating the conflicts between traditional cost-minimization approaches and environmental and social objectives to address broader sustainability challenges.

From a methodological perspective, I am interested in developing and applying techniques from evolutionary multi-objective optimization, stochastic optimal control, and artificial intelligence to address complex sustainability challenges.
