# Research

## Integrated Assessment Modelling of Climate Change
My main research deals with integrated assessment modelling (IAM) of climate change.  
In particular, I am interested in improving decision making support systems in this context using:
- multi-objective optimization
- evolutionary algorithms
- reinforcement learning
- optimal control
- stochastic models

## Other research interests:
- Energy-water nexus: integrated modelling of regional energy and water systems for:
  + joint optimization
  + impact and vulnerability assessment of electricity systems under climate change
- Water resources systems modelling and simulation
- Limnology

# Work experience
I did an internship and worked as a research assistant with EPFL & Eawag studying the bacterial layer in lake Cadagno, Switzerland.
