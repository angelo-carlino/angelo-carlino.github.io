<hr>

I am a postdoctoral fellow in the <a href="https://climateenergylab.org/">Climate Energy Lab</a> at the Carnegie Institution for Science at Stanford, USA. I am currently working on decision-making under uncertainty for technological innovation and energy system modeling.
<br>

In my research, I am interested in developing and applying methods to address complex sustainability challenges, in particular, to support infrastructural planning for the energy and water sectors and climate policy design. See more at <a href="angelo-carlino.github.io/Research.html"> Research Interest</a>.
<br>

I earned my BSc and MSc in Environmental Engineering from Politecnico di Milano where I also obtained my PhD in Information Technology in 2022 in the <a href="https://www.ei.deib.polimi.it/"> Environmental Intelligence Lab</a>. 
After that, I was a visiting postdoctoral scholar at the <a href="https://naturalcapitalproject.stanford.edu/"> Natural Capital Project</a> at Stanford University. See more at <a href="angelo-carlino.github.io/Education.html"> Education</a>.
